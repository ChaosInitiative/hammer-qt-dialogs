## STYLE

This repo uses the ~~patented VALVe vomit barf code~~ Hungarian formatting style.

Things to keep in mind:
* Hungarian notation for pointers (pFemaleDog and m_pEndMeNow for member ptrs)
* C prefix for classes
* No namespace indent 
* Newline before all braces
* Pascal case class names
* tier0/memdbgon.h must be the last include in a header!!!
